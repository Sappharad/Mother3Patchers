# Windows / Linux Mother 3 Patchers
This version of the patcher was created as a replacement for the original patcher, as the source code was lost.

It was created in June 2013, using Visual Studio 2010 which was the current version at that time. The code should compile and run fine using Visual Studio 2019.
