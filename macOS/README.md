# macOS Mother 3 Patchers
Contains separate XCode projects for each language.

Projects are located under the appropriate folders inside ups_v03/ups/. For Example: ups_v03/ups/Mother3UPS/ contains the English version. All 3 languages share the same UPS code, which is why the project was organized this way. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it actually wasn't because some of the shared code contains error messages in English.

I do not reccomend using this version of UPS in future projects, it is very old and there are better libraries for applying UPS now such as Floating IPS.
